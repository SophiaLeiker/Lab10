## beepr beeps
Use the function 'beep()' in the beepr package to make an audio alert when your code is done running

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#eval=false so it doesn't run every time you knit the document
#Creating a sequence(1:99) which would count upward, putting the rev in front of it makes it go backwards

for (i in rev(seq(1:999))) {
  
  print(paste(i, "bottles of beer on the wall")) 
}

#beep(4) #add this so at the end so a sound will be made after this part of the code has been run
```

## Praise and cowsay

Packages built with a single purpose: to be kind and fun.

```{r}
#praise("${Exclamation}, ${EXCLAIMATION}...${exclamation}!!!")

praise("Holy ${creating}, Batman - this code is ${ADJECTIVE}!")
```

Use cowsay::say() to make a character say something to you
